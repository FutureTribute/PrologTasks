# PrologTasks

Prolog solutions to different small tasks.
Almost each file contains an example of how to use it so use that to figure out what it does. Some of the files even have a description on Ukrainian language so If you aren't lazy like me you can try to translate it. Maybe one day I'll add proper descriptions to these tasks but... I'll be honest with you - there is a very small chance that will happen.

Do whatever you want with them.
